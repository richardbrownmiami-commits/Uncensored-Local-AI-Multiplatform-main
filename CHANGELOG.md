## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Global Loading Overlay**: Real-time feedback during large model imports with dynamic pulse messages.
- **Deduplication Logic**: Prevents duplicate model cards and synchronized loading states for models with the same filename.
- **Log Viewer**: New "Logs" screen accessible from the drawer to track and share system logs for troubleshooting.
- **RAM/Size Validation**: Safety dialogs that warn users before importing or loading models that exceed device resource thresholds.
- **Manual Cache Management**: "Clear Temporary Cache" button in settings to reclaim storage from interrupted imports.

### Changed
- **Optimized Model Imports**: Switched from slow stream-copying to instantaneous file-renaming (moving) for local file imports.
- **Startup Resilience**: App no longer crashes on splash screen if the Local API port is already in use.
- **UI Improvements**: Hidden '0%' percentage text on local imports for a cleaner indeterminate loading state.
- **Version Bump**: Updated app version to v2.0.0.

### Fixed
- **Ghost Writing**: Resolved issue where AI generation continued after tapping the "Stop" button.
- **Temporary Cache Bloat**: Automatic cleanup of massive temporary files after successful model imports.
- **Address in Use Error**: Handled socket exceptions in `LocalApiServerService`.
